Work in progress 3D model rocket visualizer program.

## TODO
- [ ] Configuration UI
  - [ ] Model import
  - [ ] Data log file import
    - [ ] Standardized log file format
    - [ ] Ability to omit certain fields (like TVC data, orientation, inertial acceleration) and have some of them computed by the visualizer
    - [ ] Field remapper for non-standardized log files
  - [ ] Camera angle selection
  - [ ] Time scale control
  - [ ] Timeline?
    - [ ] Mark various events (burnout, apogee, time scale transitions) and state transitions (like for Rigidbody state)
- [ ] Video file export
- [ ] Better motor exhaust VFX
- [ ] Better scenery
- [ ] Parachutes
